## 🌟 Project Overview

The Event Management System is a comprehensive platform for both event organizers and attendees. Organizers can create events, manage bookings, and track statistics, while attendees can browse events, book tickets, and manage their registrations. The system features:
- Fully role-based user authentication (organizer, attendee, optional admin)
- Event creation, editing, and deletion
- Real-time ticket booking and availability tracking
- Dashboards and analytics for event performance
- Secure payment and registration flows
- Modern and responsive user interface

### Architecture & Key Components

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap for fast, responsive UI
- **Backend**: Python (Flask), with Flask-Login and Flask-WTF for security and forms
- **Database**: MySQL, managed via SQLAlchemy ORM
- **Authentication**: Role-based access, password hashing, session management
- **Dashboards**: Chart.js for real-time stats and analytics
- **Modular Structure**:
  ```
