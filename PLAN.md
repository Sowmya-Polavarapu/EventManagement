## Features Breakdown

### User Roles
1. **Attendee**:
   - Register/Login
   - Browse events (filter by date/location/category)
   - View event details
   - Book tickets (limited by event capacity)
   - View bookings in profile/dashboard

2. **Organizer**:
   - Register/Login
   - Create/edit/delete events
   - View/manage ticket sales and attendee lists
   - Dashboard showing event summary

3. **Admin** (Optional):
   - Login as admin
   - Manage all users and events
   - Delete events/users if needed

## Features and Modules

### 1. Authentication System
- **User Registration**: Separate forms for attendee and organizer registration.
- **Login**: Redirect based on roles.
- **Password Hashing**: Secure passwords using Flask-Bcrypt.

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- Restrict routes based on user roles.
- Use Flask's `@login_required` and custom decorators for role verification.

### 3. Event Management
- **Event Model**:
  - Title, description, date, location, capacity, price, organizer_id.
- **CRUD Operations**:
  - Organizers can create, update, and delete events.

### 4. Event Booking
- **Booking Model**:
  - Event ID, user ID, ticket quantity, total price, booking timestamp.
- Validate bookings against event capacity.

### 5. Dashboards
- **Attendee Dashboard**:
  - View booked tickets.
- **Organizer Dashboard**:
  - View events created by the organizer.
  - View ticket sales and attendee lists.

### 6. Event Listing
- Public listing of events.
- Filters for date, location, and category.
- Dynamic search and sorting.

### 7. Optional Features
- Ticket Download (PDF generation).
- QR Code for event check-in.
- Analytics for ticket sales.
